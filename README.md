I've realised that the general public doesn't really know what scientists do day-to-day - I didn't know either, as a BSc student. This is a loose listing of things scientists in various institutions are supposed to do, based on what I've been in contact with, or what I had to do. I don't think there exists a single scientist who is good at all of the below.

I'm hoping to use this as a starting point on how to think about what students are learning at university, and what I teach my PhD/MSc students - I assume all scientists had to self-teach most of this.

Note: This is a work-in-progress, there's a lot of stuff missing, and I'm only an early career researcher, so there's more in science I haven't seen.

Second note: I am white, heterosexual male so there's a whole universe of things women, minorities, LGBT+, etc. have to learn in science that I am blind to.

Third note: Thanks to my supervisors Prof. Jacqueline Batley and Prof. Dave Edwards without whom I wouldn't know about 80% of the points below.

Fourth note: I tried to thank everyone for their input including their academic title, please let me know if I got something wrong

I'm happy to keep on working on this list and I accept PRs/issues.

* How to innovate - flipped classrooms etc. (thanks Dr. Adrian Paterson/@Darwinnernz!)

# Mentoring

I explicitly split this up from teaching as it's a completely different skill-set (IMHO).

* How to find good PhD, MSc students
* How to make sure that the people you found are actually good, or have the potential to be good
* How to come up with just the right project that fits with the peculiarities of a given student

# Funding

* How to find funding opportunities
* How to learn about the 'tricks' each funding opportunity has (ex: In Australia, DECRAs are available 5 years post-PhD, with only 2 tries possible. So everybody applies in the last 2 years to have a track record as good as possible.)
* How to best apply for funding ('Write what they want do hear, not what you want to do, then take the money and do what you wanted to do in the first place')
* How to calculate the budget of the funding application
* How to spend research/grant money the most efficient way
